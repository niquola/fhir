In general, the  English  &quot;middle name&quot;  concept is all of the given names after the first. This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of &quot;mellomnavn&quot;/&quot;mellannamn&quot;.

Initials do not imply a trailing period since this would not work with non-Latin scripts. Initials may consist of more than one letter, e.g., &quot;Ph.&quot; could stand for &quot;Philippe&quot; or &quot;Th.&quot; for &quot;Thomas&quot;.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"
